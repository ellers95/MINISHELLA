Could we write here if merged and what we made, with date?

We can clean the log in every 3 days or so ...

6.9 Added malloc check at the beginning. Changed exit codes to clean struct (mebbe instead of clean_struct, all exit should use clean_struct(bana)?

9.9 Now here_dog is working with pipes and redirections (changed the placement of token cleaner)

9.9 none of the non built-in command work on the first try after opening shell, but work normally on the second try XD
