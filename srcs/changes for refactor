parsing -> lexer 
	it only tokenises now
	moved del_quotes to lexer

bananice -> parsing
	the functions get called in lexer and parsing funcion

commnad_search -> execution
	calls pipex and stuff




banananice(bana, tokens, token_index);
	command_search(bana, bana->envp, &bana->env);

	bana->envp = list_to_eepie(&bana->env);
	free_char_array(bana->envp);


change redirections and pipex to use bana->envp


move builtin function into their own file with their helpers and change filenames

create a folder for the redirections, funky arrows file handling

everything else can go to folder e.g. utils

except signaling

remove unused files

combine files with 1 function called in 1 place

reorganise minishell.h
norminette heredoc and rename
